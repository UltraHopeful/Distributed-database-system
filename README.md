I have done this project in CSCI 5408 - Data Management Warehousing Analytics during my Masters of Applied Computer Science.
The project aims to build a distributed database management system connected using two virtual machines in the Google Cloud Platform. The modules included in this project are:
Query parser.
Query transaction.
Analytics based on logs.
Generating the log files.
Exporting ERD or Dump files.
All these features will be secured using an authentication system for every user. In addition, the registration feature is there for new users to register. Here the two servers are used if any of the servers crashes, then the user can access the data from another server.

Resources used in this project:
Google Virtual Machine
Java
